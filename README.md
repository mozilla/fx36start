# Firefox 3.6 Start Page

This is a very simple static website generator for the Firefox 3.6 start page.

Based on [nocturnal](https://github.com/mozilla/nocturnal/), it takes a single
jinja2 template, throws in some translations from .lang files,, and generates a
bunch of static, localized output files.

## Usage

### Checkout

    git clone git://github.com/mozilla/fx36start.git

The localization files live in SVN. Check them out into the subdirectory
"locale" to pull in translations.

    cd fx36start
    svn checkout https://svn.mozilla.org/projects/l10n-misc/trunk/fx36start/locale/

### Generating output files

Specify a version (passive or urgent) and an output directory (it shouldn't be
the same directory as the repo) and allow a few seconds for the script to scrape
Mozilla's FTP server.

    ./generate.py --version passive --output-dir html

To delete the output dir before generating the output (careful!), use
the --force option.

    ./generate.py --version passive --output-dir html -f

### Extracting .lang files

If you change localizable strings in the templates, you'll want to extract those
strings and add them to the .lang files.

    ./l10n_extract.py

should do the trick. This relies on gettext for the extraction.
